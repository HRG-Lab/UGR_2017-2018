# Digital Beamforming Experiment #


### Description of Current Project ###

We are performing an experiment in which we set up multiple antenna arrays in some space which will track an object a moving object while in the presence of a jammer.

## Progress ##


* March 2
    * Progress:
        * Created a linear array python script (linear_array_null_placement_animated.py) in which we can steer a beam and place nulls in arbitrary locations <br />

        *Pictured Above: 48 element linear array with half wavelength spacing directed at 70 degrees, nulled at  45 degrees* <br /> <br />
    * Goal For Next Week:
        * Create a circular array python script in which we can steer a beam and place nulls in arbitrary locations

* March 9
    * Progress:
        * Researched more heavily into the math behind Juan A. Torres-Rosario's antenna array research paper
        * Created a 3d Circular Array Python script (circular_array_null_placement_mar9.py) which severely needs debugging <br />

        *Pictured Above: Output of Current Script* <br /> <br />
    * Goal For Next Week:
        * Debug the circular array script into something that works
