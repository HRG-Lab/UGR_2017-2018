Computer vision recognition and positioning system using open source Python libraries.

Libraries required:
  - Numpy
  - TensorFlow (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)
  - OpenCV (https://github.com/opencv/opencv)
  - freenect (https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect)
  
In progress:
  - Boxing in recognized object to get pixel information
    - Possible solution with tensorbox (https://github.com/Russell91/TensorBox)
    - Other solution may involve switching to dlib for object detection/recognition (https://github.com/davisking/dlib)
  - Calibrations with Kinect using freenect
