* Download python-networkmanager

* Run wifiMonitor.py (in python-networkmanager/examples) to monitor all wifi signals and save them to a .csv
  - This may need a while loop to continuously monitor signals, I can't remember how I wrote it TBH.

* Run train to train a k-means detector on the datasets

* Run wifiWayfinder.py to make predictions on current location
