The debug mode is not compiled in by default.
This mode is only really useful for debugging the packet generation aspect of libxbee.
If you don't know if you want this mode, you probrably don't.

If you want a go anyway, then you must add this line to your 'config.mk' file, and rebuild libxbee:
	MODELIST+= debug
