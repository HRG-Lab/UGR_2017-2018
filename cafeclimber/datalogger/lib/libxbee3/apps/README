These are applications that I have written that use libxbee.

In order for them to run, you will need to have executed 'make install' in the
source root so that libxbee is avaliable for use at runtime.

Alternatively you can use the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to specify
an alternate (out of system dirs) location for libxbee.
