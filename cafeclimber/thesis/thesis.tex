%These are common AMS packages. Many LaTeX documents
%have these packages declared in their preambles.
\usepackage{amsmath, amsthm}

%This package allows for the use of graphics in the
%document.
\usepackage{graphicx}

%It is best practice to keep all your pictures in
%one folder inside the main directory in which your
%TeX file is kept. Here the folder is named "graphic."
%Replace the name here with your folder's name, if needed.
%The period is needed due to relative referencing.
\graphicspath{ {./graphic/} }

%If needed, this will allow you to add the word "Page"
%to extra pages on your front matter lists.

%This is from the mdwtools package; it fixes some
%footnote commands and allows you to have footnotes in
%tables via the savenotes environment.

% Hyperref setup below.  You should be able to get away with using uncommenting just the first line.
%\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}

% if \usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref} doesn't work try this.
%\usepackage{hyperref}  % Hidelinks is an option that removes link visiability.  TAMU Thesis Offices prefers to not see the links. But often doesn't work.

%\hypersetup{
%    colorlinks=true,
%    linkcolor=black,

%%%%%%%  End of hyperref setup.  One of these two options should work, but my motto with hyperref is when in doubt, comment it out!
%%%%%%%%%  This hopefully fixes the problem with vertical spacing of section headings at the top of the page..  Commented out in 1.0.7
% \preto\section{%
% \ifnum\value{section}>0\addtocontents{toc}{\vskip-6pt}\fi
