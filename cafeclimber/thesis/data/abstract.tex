\indent This is the first numbered page Arabic numeral 1. Page
numbers are outside the 1 inch margins (on all sides), at the bottom of the page and centered; everything else is inside the margins. No bold on this page (Exception: heading ABSTRACT is bold if major headings are bold. Text begins two double spaces below the major heading. Recommended length of
text is no more than 350 words. Vertical spacing is double spaced or
space-and-a-half. (\emph{This \LaTeX ~ template applies double space for this
ABSTRACT.}) The same margin settings and text alignment are followed else where
in this thesis. There should be no numbered references or formal citations in
the ABSTRACT.

The content of this ABSTRACT provides a complete, succinct snapshot of the
research, addressing the purpose, methods, results, and conclusions of the
research. As a result, it should stand alone without any formal citations or
references to chapters/sections of the work. To accommodate with a variety of online database, images or complex equations should also be avoided.

The next pages are Dedication, Acknowledgments, and Nomenclature.
